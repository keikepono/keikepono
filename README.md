### What I do
I worked as a Developer at [Redd Summit Advisors](https://www.reddsummit.com/), the largest PRF insurance company in the United States. My role at the company was to move a legacy desktop application online and integrate it with pre-existing applications. The application allows agents to create maps to build policies to sell to ranchers across the United States without requiring any technical background.
