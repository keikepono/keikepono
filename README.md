### Where I learned it
I learned GIS through my Geology degree, found it interesting and took every class available at UVU and earned a certificate in GIS. I got a job at Redd Summit Advisors and combined my GIS desktop skills with my Python skills to create a desktop application. That application proved to be very successful and scalable so I was tasked with moving it online and integrating existing technology into one central tech hub. I learned all my other development skills on the job while moving the legacy desktop application online.
