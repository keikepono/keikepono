### What I do
I worked as a Developer at [Redd Summit Advisors](https://www.reddsummit.com/), the largest PRF insurance company in the United States. My role at the company was to move a legacy desktop application online and integrate it with pre-existing applications. The application allows agents to create maps to build policies to sell to ranchers across the United States without requiring any technical background.

### Where I learned it
I learned GIS through my Geology degree, found it interesting and took every class available at UVU and earned a certificate in GIS. I got a job at Redd Summit Advisors and combined my GIS desktop skills with my Python skills to create a desktop application. That application proved to be very successful so I was tasked with moving it online and integrating existing technology into one central tech hub. After my time at Redd Summit Advisors I moved to North Carolina and am working on finishing my Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering (expected graduation June 1 2024).
